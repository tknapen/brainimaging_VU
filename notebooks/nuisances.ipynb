        "This week's lab is about preprocessing of fMRI data. Preprocessing of (f)MRI data is quite a complex topic, involving techniques from signal-processing (high-pass filtering), linear algebra/statistics (prewhitening/autocorrelation correction), and optimization (image registration). Additionally, there is ongoing discussion about which preprocessing steps are necessary/sufficient and what preprocessing parameters are optimal. As always, this depends on your specific research question, the type and quality of your data, and the type of analysis.\n",

        "As we said before, preprocessing is a topic that almost warrants its own course. Nonetheless, we'll try to show you (and let you practice with) some of the most common and important preprocessing operations. Additionally, we'll introduce the concept of the fast fourier transform, which allows us to analyze our signal in the frequency domain, which helps to understand several preprocessing steps, such as temporal filtering.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.1. The (conceptual) t-value formula -- yet again\n",
        "The previous two weeks, you have learned that, essentially, we want to find large effects (calculated as t-values) of our contrasts by optimizing various parts of the t-value formula. Conceptually, the t-value formula can be written as:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\begin{align}\n",
        "t\\mathrm{-value} = \\frac{\\mathrm{effect}}{\\mathrm{uncertainty}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{effect}}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{noise} \\cdot \\mathrm{design\\ variance}}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{c}\\hat{\\beta}}{\\sqrt{\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}\\mathbf{c}(X'X')^{-1}\\mathbf{c}'}}\n",
        "\\end{align}\n",
        "\n",
        "Last week you've learned that by ensuring low design variance (through *high* predictor variance and *low* predictor correlations) leads to larger normalized effects (higher t-values). This week, we will discuss the other term of the denominator of this formula: the noise (also called the residual variance or unexplained variance), which is defined in the t-value formula as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\begin{align}\n",
        "\\mathrm{noise} = \\frac{SSE}{\\mathrm{DF}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(y_{i} - \\hat{y_{i}})^{2}}{N - P}\n",
        "\\end{align}\n",
        "\n",
        "Through preprocessing, we aim to reduce the difference between our prediction ($\\hat{y}$) and our true signal ($y$), thus reducing the noise-term of the formula and thereby optimizing our normalized effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2. The two approaches of preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "Basically, there are *two* ways to preprocess your data:\n",
        "1. Manipulating the signal ($y$) **directly** *before* fitting your GLM-model;\n",
        "2. Including \"noise predictors\" in your design ($X$) when fitting your model;\n",
        "\n",
        "Often, preprocessing steps can be done both by method 1 (manipulating the signal directly) and by method 2 (including noise predictors). For example, one of the videos showed that you could apply a high-pass filter by applying a \"gaussian weighted running line smoother\" (the method FSL employs) *directly* on the signal (method 1) **or** you could add \"low-frequency (drift) predictors\" to the design matrix (method 2; in the video they used a 'discrete cosine basis set'; the SPM method). In practice, both methods often yield very similar resuls. The most important thing to understand is that both methods are trying to accomplish the same goal: reduce the noise term of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, we will discuss how temporal and spatial filtering can *directly* filter the signal (method 1) to reduce error. Later in the tutorial, we will discuss including adding outlier-predictors and motion-predictors to the design to reduce noise (method 2). \n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Temporal filtering\n",
        "In this section, we will discuss how temporal filtering of the voxel signals may greatly reduce the error term. Along the way, we will also explain how we can look at the representation of the signal in the frequency domain (using the fourier transform) to give us an idea about the nature of the noise components in our data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.1. A short primer on the frequency domain and the fourier transform\n",
        "Thus far, we've always looked at our fMRI-signal as activity that varies across **time**. In other words, we're always looking at the signal in the *time domain*. However, there is also a way to look at a signal in the *frequency domain* (also called 'spectral domain') through transforming the signal using the *Fourier transform*. \n",
        "\n",
        "Basically, the fourier transform calculates to which degree sine waves of different frequencies are present in your signal. If a sine wave of a certain frequency (let's say 2 hertz) is (relatively) strongly present in your signal, it will have a (relatively) high *power* in the frequency domain. Thus, looking at the frequency domain of a signal can tell you something about the frequencies of the (different) sources underlying your signal.\n",

Well, it should, because it's essentially the same type of filter as we used for our temporal high-pass filter! Only this time, it's not a 1-dimensional gaussian (\"kernel\") that does the high-pass filtering, but it's a 3-dimensional gaussian that does *low-pass* filtering.

This technique is also sometimes called \"despiking\". These spikes reflect sudden large intensity increases in the signal across the entire brain that likely reflect scanner instabilities. One way to deal with these artifacts is to \"censor\" bad timepoints (containing the spike) in your signal using a noise-predictor.\n",

One way is to average the timeseries across all voxels, generating one single 'global signal' (which makes sense because spikes usually affect measurements across the entire brain), and then apply a z-transform of this global signal, and subsequently identify spikes as any value above a certain threshold. For example, setting this threshold at 5 means that any activity value more than 5 standard deviations from the mean global signal intensity is defined as a spike.\n",

When subjects move in the scanner, the homogeneity of the magnetic field is decreased, voxels are shifted in space from timepoint to timepoint, and spurious (de)activity may occur (during modeling). As such, it is *very* important to deal with motion appropriately. By far the *most important thing* you can do to reduce the effect of motion is simply to try to make the subject move as little as possible!\n",

These algorithms usually start out with random values for these six parameters, for which they calculate the \"mismatch\" (also called \"cost\"; for example in terms of the \"correlation distance\" between the realigned volume and the reference volume, $1 - \\rho(vol, ref\\_vol)$).

For example, suppose that you measure a single voxel in someone's brain; then, this person moves his/her hea†d 2 centimeters. Now, we can do motion realigment to make sure we measure the same voxel before and after the movement, but *this does not change the fact that this particular voxel was originally measured at two different locations*. It could be that after the movement, the voxel was actually a little bit closer to the headcoil, which results in a (slight) increase in signal compared to before the movement (this is also known as 'spin history effects').\n",

        "Ideally, you want to account for these interactions between motion and the measured activity. One way to do this is through \"motion filtering\", of which one popular approach is to simply add the 6 realignment parameters (rotation and translation in 3 directions) to the design-matrix ($X$)! In other words, we treat the motion realignment parameters as \"nuisance regressors\" that are aimed to explain activity that is related to motion.\n",
